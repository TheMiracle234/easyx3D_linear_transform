# easyx3D_linear_transform_tmptmp
Use easyx to visualize the 3d graph with linear transformation functions.

If you want to add graphs or surfaces, do it as to main.cpp.

If you want to use it to see the effect quickly, download the matrixWork.exe and matrixWork.pdb to run the program.

IDE：visual studio

Dependency：easyx.h

Change the character set to Multi-Byte Character Set in Properties → Advanced → Character Set.

operation：

wsad: ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️

zxc: rotation transformations around x,y,z axes

bnm: opposite directions of zxc

Numeric Keypad (General Linear Transformations):

1/2/3: Transform i-vector

4/5/6: Transform j-vector

7/8/9: Transform k-vectorp：改变线性变换的方向

p:change the direction of general linear transformations


q: show the matrix of linear transformations

e：show structure lines of how graphs are made

r: restore transformations

esc：exit


This is my third cpp program and the first one to upload on github. I know little about how the program may influent others on the platform. But it means or will mean a lot to me I guess. It is not up to the level of doing something officially. It's kind of for fun. And the visualization has some bugs I'm not able to solve.
